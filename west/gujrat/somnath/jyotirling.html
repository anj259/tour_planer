            <h1>Somnath Temple, Somnath</h1>
            <p>
                The Somnath Jyotirlinga Temple is first of the twelve Jyotirlinga
                shrines of Lord Shiva. It is located on the western coast of Gujarat
                and is one of the oldest temples of the country. It has been mentioned 
                in ancient texts like Shreemad Bhagavat Gita, Skandpuran, Shivpuran and 
                Rig-Veda which signifies the importance of this temple as one of the most
                celebrated pilgrimage sites. The temple is located on the ancient Triveni
                Sangam or the confluence of three rivers - Kapila, Hiran, and Saraswati.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temple is known as an eternal shrine owing to its perseverance
                against the test of time. It has withstood several destructions in the
                past and still has not lost its beauty. It is said that the temple was 
                looted and destroyed as many as seventeen times by emperors like Mahmud Ghazni,
                Alauddin Khilji, and Aurangzeb.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the force behind the revival and 
                reconstruction of the present-day temple in 1951 which still serves as a
                notable edifice of the original Somnath Temple. It attracts millions of 
                devotees all throughout the year.
