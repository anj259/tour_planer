            <h1>Dholavira, Kutch </h1>
            <p>
                It is one of the largest remarkable excavations of the Indus Valley
                 Civilization which was one of the most developed civilization roughly 
                 4500 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Witness the history yourself! A visit to the site tells the story of 
                the 7 stages of the civilization and it is considered to be one of the
                grandest cities of its time. It is one of the 5 largest Harappan sites 
                and the most prominent archaeological sites in India belonging to the
                Indus Valley Civilization. This place was occupied from around 2650
                BCE to 1450 BCE with a brief abandonment period.

                Many remains such as earthen pots, beads, jewellery and other materials
                were excavated as well. The town of Dholavira had an exceptional water 
                ation system. Two of its most important water channels were the Mansar and the
                Manhar.
