        <p>
            Somnath, literally meaning 'lord of the moon' is a pilgrim center
            and is home to one of the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is a town which derives
            much of its identity from the mythology, religion, and legends that surround it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primarily a temple town, Somnath is a place where a strong scent of
            religion and legends lingers around tourism and even daily life. Its
            spiritual environment is ornamented by the huge number of temples in the
            area, however, Somnath also offers beaches, museums and other attractions.
            While the Somnath temple and Somnath beach are the primary places to visit
            here, Gita Mandir, Balukha Tirtha, Kamnath Mahadev Temple, Somnath Museum
            are some of the other places that one can visit.
